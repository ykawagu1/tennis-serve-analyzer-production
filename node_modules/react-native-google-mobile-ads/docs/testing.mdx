# Testing

The React Native Google Mobile Ads library depends on a lot of platform-specific native code which you likely want to mock in your tests.

## Testing with Jest

This library ships with a Jest setup file that mocks the native code for you.
To use it, add the following to your Jest configuration:

```json
// jest.config.js|ts|mjs|cjs|json
{
  "setupFiles": [
    "./node_modules/react-native-google-mobile-ads/jest.setup.ts"
  ]
}
```
